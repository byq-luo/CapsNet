# CapsNet
Tensorflow implementation of capsule network for traffic prediction.
Built with Python 3.5

- Obtain image representation of spatio-temporal time series data (real data of Santander city)
- Compare capsule network (CapsNet) and convolutional neural network (CNN) in a short-term traffic speed forecasting problem
