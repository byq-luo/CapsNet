# CapsNet
Tensorflow implementation of capsule network for traffic prediction.
Built with Python 3.5

- Obtain spatio-temporal image representation of traffic speed data, which are time series data with spatial relationship (real data of Santander city)
- Compare capsule network (CapsNet) and convolutional neural network (CNN) in a short-term traffic speed forecasting problem
